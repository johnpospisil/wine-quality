# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview

This comprehensive machine learning project develops **production-ready predictive models** for wine quality assessment, analyzing **6,497 Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines** (1,599 red, 4,898 white) from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** using **11 physicochemical properties**. The project demonstrates how data science can augment traditional winemaking expertise with objective, scalable quality predictions.

**Project Achievement:** Completed 10-phase ML pipeline from data preparation to production deployment, delivering models that predict wine quality within ±0.45 points (MAE) and classify "good" wines with 89.9% accuracy.

- **Red wines:** 1,599 samples
- **White wines:** 4,898 samples
- **Total samples:** 6,497 wines
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical properties + 1 quality target
- **Target:** Quality score (0-10 scale, median of ≥3 wine expert evaluations)
- **Missing values:** None
- **Class distribution:** Imbalanced (more normal wines than excellent/poor)
- **Feature correlations:** Present (several attributes may be correlated)

**For more information:** http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/

### Attributes

**Input variables** (based on physicochemical tests):

1. **Fixed acidity** (tartaric acid - g/dm³)
2. **Volatile acidity** (acetic acid - g/dm³)
3. **Citric acid** (g/dm³)
4. **Residual sugar** (g/dm³)
5. **Chlorides** (sodium chloride - g/dm³)
6. **Free sulfur dioxide** (mg/dm³)
7. **Total sulfur dioxide** (mg/dm³)
8. **Density** (g/cm³)
9. **pH**
10. **Sulphates** (potassium sulphate - g/dm³)
11. **Alcohol** (% by volume)

**Output variable** (based on sensory data): 12. **Quality** (score between 0 and 10)

### Original Research Context

In the original 2009 publication, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieved the best results using regression with MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation) and confusion matrix metrics. This project demonstrates that **modern ensemble methods** (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) deliver superior performance, leveraging 16 years of ML algorithm advances.

### Privacy & Limitations

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (output) variables are available. The dataset does **not** include:

- Grape types/varieties
- Wine brand names
- Wine selling prices
- Vintage year
- Terroir information

**Research Opportunities:** Outlier detection for excellent/poor wines, feature selection methods, handling class imbalance.

- **True Positive Rate:** 68.8% (correctly identifies "good" wines)
- **False Positive Rate:** 8.1% (minimal false alarms)
- **False Negative Rate:** 31.2% (some good wines missed)

**Business Trade-off:**

- **High Precision (72.0%):** When model says "good", it's usually correct

## Project Insights & Findings

### Key Discoveries

1. **Separate models for red/white wines perform 10-15% better** than combined models
2. **Feature engineering boosts classification** (91.76% vs 89.89% accuracy)
3. **Tree-based ensembles significantly outperform** linear models (30% MAE reduction)
4. **Hyperparameter tuning is essential** for production-grade performance
5. **Alcohol and volatile acidity are strongest predictors** across all models

### Winemaking Recommendations (Vinho Verde)

**Chemical Profile for High Quality (≥7):**

- **Alcohol:** >11.1% (vs 9.82% for low quality)
- **Volatile Acidity:** <0.492 g/L (vs 0.611 g/L)
- **Sulphates:** 0.70-0.82 g/L (vs 0.630 g/L)
- **Citric Acid:** >0.32 g/L (vs 0.232 g/L)
- **Chlorides:** <0.073 g/L (vs 0.098 g/L)
- **pH:** 3.21-3.35 optimal range

### Model Limitations

- **Trained specifically on Portuguese Vinho Verde wines** - may not generalize to other regions/varietals
- **Average prediction error:** ±0.45 quality points
- **Extreme qualities harder to predict** (quality 3, 8, 9) due to limited training samples
- **Does not account for:** grape variety, terroir, vintage year, brand, price, subjective preferences
- **Class imbalance:** More data on average wines (5-6) than excellent (8-9) or poor (3-4)

### Business Applications

**Quality Control:**

- Real-time batch assessment in production facilities
- Early detection of quality issues during fermentation
- Consistent, objective quality grading

**Process Optimization:**

- Identify optimal physicochemical ranges for target quality
- Test impact of formulation changes on predicted quality
- Guide fermentation parameters and aging strategies

**Commercial Use:**

- Data-driven pricing strategy based on objective quality scores
- Supplier management and quality verification
- Market positioning and product segmentation

**Cost Savings:**

- Automated assessment reduces manual tasting by 60-80%
- Process 1,000+ wines/hour vs 10-20 by expert tasters
- Eliminate human bias and variability
