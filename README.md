7. ✅ Compared original vs engineered feature performance

**Key Results**:

- **Regression**: Minimal impact (-0.75% to -1.5% change in MAE)
  - Gradient Boosting already captures complex patterns
  - Original features sufficient for tree-based models
- **Binary Classification**: Slight improvement on Red wine (+2.08% accuracy)
  - Red wine with engineered features: 91.76% accuracy (vs 89.89%)
  - AUC improved from 0.9289 to 0.9302
- **Feature Importance**: Original features (alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates) still dominate
- **Best engineered features**: alcohol × sulphates, total acidity, alcohol²

**Key Insight**: Original features are already highly informative. Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) can capture non-linear relationships without explicit feature engineering.

**Recommendation**: Use original features for tree-based models, consider engineered features for linear models in Phase 7.

3. ✅ Evaluated decision boundaries and confidence levels
4. ✅ Extracted practical winemaking recommendations

- Worst predictions involve edge cases and unusual chemical combinations
- Model performance: 91.8% predictions within ±1.0 quality points

**Feature Synergies**:

- **Alcohol × Sulphates**: +0.41 quality points when both are high (>11% alcohol + >0.7 g/L sulphates)
- **Acidity Balance**: +0.96 quality points with low VA (<0.4 g/L) + high citric acid (>0.3 g/L)
- pH × Acidity interactions show minimal independent effect

**Decision Boundary Insights** (Quality 6-7 boundary):

- Overall accuracy: 80.6% near decision boundary
- High confidence predictions (>0.8): 95.9% accuracy
- Medium confidence (0.6-0.8): 74.5% accuracy
- Low confidence (<0.6): 45.8% accuracy
- **Key Insight**: Model confidence strongly correlates with accuracy

**Chemical Profile Comparison** (High Quality ≥7 vs Low Quality <6):

**Practical Winemaking Strategy**:

**Primary Actions** (Strongest Impact):

1. **Increase alcohol content**: Target >11.1% (ferment to higher ABV)
2. **Reduce volatile acidity**: Keep <0.492 g/L (temperature control, quality yeast)
3. **Optimize sulphates**: Maintain 0.70-0.82 g/L (proper SO₂ management)

**Secondary Actions** (Moderate Impact): 4. **Enhance citric acid**: Target >0.32 g/L (adds freshness) 5. **Fine-tune pH**: Maintain 3.21-3.35 (affects mouthfeel and stability) 6. **Control chlorides**: Minimize for reduced saltiness

**Synergistic Approach**:

- Combine high alcohol (>11%) with elevated sulphates (>0.7 g/L)
- Balance acidity: low volatile acidity + adequate citric acid
- Maintain pH 3.2-3.4 for optimal structure

**Visualizations Created**:
