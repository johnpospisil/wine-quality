# Quick Guide: Pushing to GitHub

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. ✓ Git repository initialized
2. ✓ All files added and committed
3. ✓ `.gitignore` created (excludes Python cache, notebooks checkpoints, etc.)
4. ✓ `requirements.txt` created (lists all dependencies)
5. ✓ Initial commit created with descriptive message

## 📋 Next Steps (Do This Now)

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/new

2. **Create the repository:**

   - Repository name: `wine-quality`
   - Description: `Machine learning project to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties`
   - Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
   - Click **"Create repository"**

3. **Copy your repository URL** - GitHub will show you commands. It will look like:

   - HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wine-quality.git`
   - SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/wine-quality.git`

4. **In your terminal**, run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

   ```bash
   cd /Users/johnpospisil/Documents/GitHub/projects/wine-quality

   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wine-quality.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Done!** Your repository is now on GitHub. Visit:
   `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wine-quality`

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If you have `gh` installed)

```bash
cd /Users/johnpospisil/Documents/GitHub/projects/wine-quality

# Create repo and push in one go
gh repo create wine-quality --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Or for private repo
gh repo create wine-quality --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## 📦 What's Included in Your Repository

```
wine-quality/
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
├── README.md               # Project documentation with all phases
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── setup_github_repo.sh    # Setup script (already used)
├── wine-quality.ipynb      # Main analysis notebook (Phases 1-3)
└── data/
    ├── winequality-red.csv
    ├── winequality-white.csv
    └── winequality.names
```

## 🔄 Future Updates

After making changes to your project, update GitHub with:

```bash
cd /Users/johnpospisil/Documents/GitHub/projects/wine-quality

git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"
git push
```

## 🎯 Common Commands

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# See what's changed
git diff

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "remote origin already exists"

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wine-quality.git
```

**Problem**: "src refspec main does not match any"

```bash
git branch -M main  # Rename master to main
git push -u origin main
```

**Problem**: Authentication failed (HTTPS)

- Use a Personal Access Token instead of your password
- Or switch to SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## 📝 Suggested Repository Settings

After creating the repository on GitHub, consider:

1. **Add topics**: machine-learning, wine-quality, python, scikit-learn, random-forest, xgboost
2. **Add a license**: MIT License (if you want others to use it)
3. **Enable Issues**: For tracking improvements
4. **Add a description**: "Predicting wine quality using ensemble ML models"
