## 🎯 Actionable Insights for Winemakers

### Primary Quality Improvement Factors

1. **Alcohol Content** (+18.8% in high-quality wines)

   - Target: >11% ABV
   - Action: Ferment to higher alcohol levels

2. **Volatile Acidity** (-34.3% in high-quality wines)

   - Target: <0.5 g/L
   - Action: Temperature control, quality yeast selection

3. **Sulphates** (+18.7% in high-quality wines)

   - Target: 0.7-0.8 g/L
   - Action: Proper SO₂ management

4. **Citric Acid** (+56.9% in high-quality wines)
   - Target: >0.32 g/L
   - Action: Enhance freshness

### Feature Synergies Discovered

- **Alcohol × Sulphates**: +0.41 quality points when both elevated
- **Acidity Balance**: +0.96 quality points with low VA + high citric acid
- **pH × Total Acidity**: Optimal at pH 3.2-3.4
